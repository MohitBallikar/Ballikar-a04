/*
Construct a program that reads in the following data file
(you will need to create this data file yourself;
name it `exercise42_input.txt`)
Process the records and display the results formatted as a table,
evenly spaced, as shown in the example output.
    Write your own code to parse the data. Don't use a CSV parser.

    Similar I/O structure as 41 could be used to read the data, and possibly even print/format
    Data must be parsed manually
    Make sure that the printing follows the necessary requirements for formatting
