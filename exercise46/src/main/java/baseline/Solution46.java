/*
Create a program that reads in a file named `exercise46_input.txt`
and counts the frequency of words in the file.
Then construct a histogram displaying the words and the frequency,
and display the histogram to the screen.

    Ensure that the most used word is at the top of the report and the least used words are at the bottom.

    Will most definitely use loops to check for each term, as well as printing the histogram values.
        Follow file I/O as per usual to read the file
    Tests could check to see if the function(s) correctly display the values in descending order and are not hard-coded
        May need to split up functions to make them easier to test or to optimize structure(s)
